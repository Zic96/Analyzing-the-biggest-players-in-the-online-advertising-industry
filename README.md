# Analyzing-the-biggest-players-in-the-online-advertising-industry

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/237974/online-advertising-spending-worldwide/), the digital advertising spending worldwide will be **876 billion dollars in 2026**. For 2021 the spending was 521 billion dollars, so this market can grow approximately **40% in the next 5 years**. Pandemic was a critical factor that accelerate digital advertising spending.

On a global scale, we can assume this is a competitive market but we can identify some big players such as Google, Meta platforms, amazon, Microsoft, and Twitter.
Google, Meta, and Twitter are the best fit for this sector because the majority of their earnings are from advertising. However, Amazon and Microsoft operate in many sectors and one of them is digital advertising. For 2021 amazon was the third biggest advertiser in the US after Google and meta. Furthermore, Microsoft has a lot of advertising revenue streams such as LinkedIn and search engine advertising.

In this project, I will analyze some financial data for these companies and I will try to identify trends and patterns for the past 5 years. The reason I choose 5 years instead of 10 or more is because twitter is listed only 5 years.

Here are some questions I will try to answer:

* What was the daily average return for each stock?
* What patterns we can identify with the moving averages?
*	What was the correlation between these daily returns?
*	Which stocks are more volatile?
*	How much value do we gain regarding the risk ?
*	What is the value at Risk for each stock for different time frames?<br/>

And finally, I will perform some Monte Carlo simulations to predict the future possible outcomes for the stock prices.
